# AvatarStuff

## Notice

I'm taking a break from anything VRChat modding related, maybe forever. Although mostly because of burnout, it's also partly because of the bias and the bashing that goes on between developers and developer discords (not to say that everyone does this, there are some really genuine and lovely people).

I will still be updating it every now and then when it breaks (if people bring my attention to it, or submit pull requests to fix it).

Thank you so much to the people that supported me. It made me happy that I made others happy :)

## Features
