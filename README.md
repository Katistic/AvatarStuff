I'm sorry, most of the code I got was from Hash, who was found to have plagerised, which means in turn I have also.

Thank you plague for his amazing work. Make sure to join his discord [here](http://discord.me/Poppy)
(Mostly his UI stuff)

Thank you Yaekith for your work as well.
(The ui button used on the main menu was made by him)
